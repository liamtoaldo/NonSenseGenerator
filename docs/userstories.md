# User Stories
1. As a user I want to input a sentence so that I can validate the sentence structure and see the syntactic tree.
2. As a user I want the application to extract terms from my input and use them to generate a nonsense sentence, either randomly or by selecting a predefined template, so that I can reuse it in other contexts.
3. As a user I want the application to show the toxicity level of the generated sentence so that I can decide whether it is appropriate to share.
4. As a user I want to add terms from my input sentence to the available terms so that they will be re-used in the future.
5. As a user I want to select a time for the sentence to be produced so that I can generate phrases that fit specific temporal contexts.
6. As a user I want to save the sentences that I created so that I can review or reuse them later from a personal history log.
