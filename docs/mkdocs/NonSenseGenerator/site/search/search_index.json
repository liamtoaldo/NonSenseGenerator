the user stories and define the expected behavior of the system: User story 1.1 Given a user is on the sentence input part in the UI And has typed a valid (not empty) sentence When the user submits the sentence for analysis Then the system analyzes the structure using Google's analyzeSyntax and displays the syntactic tree User story 1.2 Given a user is on the sentence input part in the UI And submits an empty or invalid sentence When the user submits the sentence for analysis Then the system shows an error message to the user User story 2 Given a user has input a sentence and the program has extracted terms from it And the user has selected either a predefined template or a random one When the user asks for a sentence generation Then the system creates and displays a grammatically valid nonsense sentence using random terms and terms from the input User story 3 Given a nonsense sentence has been generated When the sentence is analyzed for toxicity using Google's moderateText Then the toxicity result for the sentence is displayed to the user User story 4.1 Given a sentence has been input and terms have been extracted And the user choose to save the terms for future use When the user confirms it through analisys Then the selected terms are saved in the public dictionary for future use and the user is notified User story 4.2 Given a term from the input is already present in the dictionary When the user attempts to add it again Then the system ignores the duplicate User story 5.1 Given a user has selected the tense (past, present, future) When the user generates the sentence Then the system applies the correct tense consistently in the generated sentence User story 5.2 Given the user does not select any tense When the user generates the sentence Then the system uses a random tense User story 6.1 Given a nonsense sentence has been generated When the user decides to save the generated sentence Then the sentence is stored with metadata (time, toxicity level, tense) User story 6.2 Given users have previously saved sentences When they access the public history log Then a chronological list of saved sentences is displayed with relevant details System Test Report","title":"System Test Document"},{"location":"system_test_document/#system-test-document","text":"","title":"System Test

please consult the project on Jira . US1 As a user I want to input a sentence so that I can validate the sentence structure and see the syntactic tree. Description Display input form where the user can input a sentence and a button to analyze it Analyze the given sentence and produce a syntactic tree Display the syntactic tree to the user Display an error message if service is not responding US 2 As a user I want the application to extract terms from my input and use them to generate a nonsense sentence, either randomly or by selecting a predefined template, so that I can reuse it in other contexts. Description Display input form where the user can input a sentence Extract terms and save them upon request Show a menu where the user can select a template or generate one randomly Use the template and all the terms saved in the application (which can include the ones inputted by the user) to generate a nonsense sentence with correct grammar Show the generated sentence to the user US 3 As a user I want the application to show the toxicity level of the generated sentence so that I can decide whether it is appropriate to share. Description Display a button to analyze the sentence toxicity after a sentence is generated and shown to the user Analyze the sentence toxicity upon confirmation Show the toxicity analysis result to the user Display an error message if service is not responding US 4 As a user I want to add terms from my input sentence to the available terms so that they will be re-used in the future. Description Display a menu to the user to select whether or not his input terms will be saved Upon confirmation, validate the selection Save the terms in the application US 5 As a user I want to select a time for the sentence to be produced so that I can generate phrases that fit specific temporal contexts. Description Display a menu where the user can select a specific tense for the generated sentence Use his choice for the generation process Use random tenses if the user didn\u2019t select one US 6 As a user I want to save the sentences that I created so that I can review or reuse them later from a public history log.
