It uses Google's Natural Language API to analyze sentence structure. It provides features for syntax analysis, sentence generation, toxicity analysis, and a public history log of generated sentences. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Technology Stack Used The NonSenseGenerator application is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies, libraries, and plugins. Below is a summary of the tech stack: Layer Technology Version Backend Java 21 Backend Spring Boot 3.1.4 Build & Dependency Management Maven (Managed by Spring) Backend Thymeleaf (Managed by Spring) Libraries (UI/UX) Bootstrap 5.3.3 Libraries (DOM) jQuery 3.7.1 Libraries (Charts) Chart.js 4.5.0 Chart.js Plugins Chart.js Chart Graphs Plugin 1.0.1 Chart.js Plugins Chart.js Data Labels Plugin 2.2.0 Libraries (Java) JSON 20250517 Libraries (Java) Dotenv 3.0.0 Testing JUnit 5 (Managed by Spring) Documentation MkDocs 1.6.1 External APIs Used The application integrates with the following external APIs: API Name Provider Purpose documents.analyzeSyntax Google Cloud Analyzes the syntax of sentences by providing a syntax tree and part-of-speech tags. documents.moderateText Google Cloud Analyzes the toxicity of sentences to determine if they contain harmful or offensive content. Installation To install and run the NonSenseGenerator application, follow these steps: Prerequisites Java 21 or higher : Check if you have Java installed by running: java -version If not installed, download and install it from Oracle's official website or use your OS package manager. Maven (not mandatory, since it's provided in the project through the nonsense/mvnw wrapper for Linux and MacOS or nonsense\\mvnw.cmd for Windows) A Google Cloud account with the Natural Language API enabled Follow the instructions in the Google Cloud documentation to set up your account and enable the API. IMPORTANT: Create the nonsense/.env file in the nonsense directory to store your API key. Obtain your API key and set it as an environment variable inside nonsense/.env : GOOGLE_NLP_API_KEY = \"your_api_key_here\" Installation Steps Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/liamtoaldo/NonSenseGenerator.git Navigate to the project directory: cd NonSenseGenerator cd nonsense Choose your installation method: Running without building It's recommended if you are a developer and want to run the application and make changes to the code. Run the application: If you have Maven installed, run: mvn spring-boot:run If you are using the provided wrapper, run: ./mvnw spring-boot:run # For Linux and MacOS mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run # For Windows Building and running the application It's recommended if you are a user and want to just use the application. Build the application: If you have Maven installed, run: mvn clean package If you are using the provided wrapper, run: ./mvnw clean package # For Linux and MacOS mvnw.cmd clean package # For Windows If you get errors because of tests, you can skip them by adding the -DskipTests flag Run the application: java -jar target/nonsense-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar Usage Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:8080 Syntax Analysis To analyze the syntax of a sentence, enter the sentence in the input field and click the \"Analyze Syntax\" button. The application will display the syntax tree and part-of-speech tags for each word in the sentence. Root nodes are red, regardless of their part of speech. Child nodes are colored based on their part of speech: Nouns: Purple Verbs: Green Adjectives: Yellow Everything else: Blue Sentence Generation To generate a nonsensical sentence, enter a sentence in the input field and click the \"Generate\" button. You can select a pre-defined template or let the system choose one for you. You can also choose the generated sentence's tense (present, past, or future) or use present tense by default. The application will display the generated sentence in the output field.
